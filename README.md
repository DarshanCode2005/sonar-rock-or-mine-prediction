## Introduction
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify objects as either rocks or mines using sonar signals. We use Logistic Regression as our classification algorithm.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Sonar dataset, which contains 208 instances and 60 attributes. Each instance represents the energy of sonar signals bounced off a surface, and the goal is to classify the surface as either a rock or a mine.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- streamlit

You can install the required libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib streamlit
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sonar-rock-or-mine-prediction.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd sonar-rock-or-mine-prediction
    ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train the model and make predictions.

## Streamlit App
To start the Streamlit app, run the following command:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
You can take a sample input from the Jupyter Notebook, which will provide `x_test` values, and paste them into the text box in the Streamlit app to make predictions.

## Results
The Logistic Regression model achieves an accuracy of approximately 80% on the test set. (Replace X with your actual result)
